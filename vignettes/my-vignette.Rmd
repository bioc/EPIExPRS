DNA methylation has been shown to be in important regulator of gene expression. 
This relationship has been shown to jointly affected by many CpG sites in a 
region, rather than by a single CpG site. The 'EPIxPRS' package provides a means
for testing these multivariate associations, in a race-specific manner, but also
methods for accounting for possible race-specifc effects in mixed-race 
populations.
